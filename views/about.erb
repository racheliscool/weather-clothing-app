    <br>
    <h2> Master Nahor </h2>
      <p> Master Nahor has been incarcerated for the past two years for being convicted of felony stalking and third degree menacing after she broke into the home of a man who she claimed to be her husband, when in reality they had only met once. However, she was recently paroled for good behavior, and is set for release in the coming weeks. She looks forward to spending quality time with her "husband" and deepening their relationship.

    <h2> Master (Fish)Bait </h2>
    <p> Master (Fish)Bait is the first women to ever be let onto the US Mens National Soccer Team, as they were unsure of her actual sex. Unfortunately, she was recently suspended after her massive steroid use was uncovered. During her suspension from the national team, she sells the used underwear of her teamates on ebay.

    <h2> Master Bee </h2>
    <p> Master Bee enjoys emotionless dinners with her extended family and sweeping all issues under the rug. She is descended from one of the first colonists and has many proud patriotic and prominent relatives. She has recently founded the NAAWP and is looking forward to furthering the mission of her new foundation.

    <h2> Master Poutine </h2>
    <p> Master Poutine is a proud Russian American. She is from a long line of members of the KGB and can trace her direct lineage to Stalin. She owns a shish kabob stand in Brighten Beach and is a proud and active member of the mob. This summer she plans to go herself to Crimea with her shotgun and carry out God's (a.k.a. Putin's) work.
